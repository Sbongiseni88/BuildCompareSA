# PROJECT FUNDING PROPOSAL: BuildCompare SA - Full Implementation Phase

## 1. Executive Summary
Following the improved MVP demonstration, this document outlines the financial and technical requirements to transition BuildCompare SA from a prototype to a fully scalable, market-ready platform.

## 2. Infrastructure & Operational Costs (Monthly)
We utilize a serverless architecture to minimize idle costs. Expenses are broken down by growth phase.

### Phase 1: MVP / Launch (Months 1-6)
*Target: 0 - 5,000 Monthly Active Users*

1.  **Hosting (Vercel Pro):** ~R370 - R400

2.  **Database (Supabase Pro):** ~R465 - R500
    - *Includes 8GB database size, daily backups, and ensures no project pausing.*
3.  **AI Intelligence (Gemini 1.5 Flash/Pro):** ~R200 - R500
    - *Pay-as-you-go. Initial usage will remain low; strictly paying for tokens processed.*
4.  **Google Maps:** R0
